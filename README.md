# Why Learning Go(4fun) in This AI-Driven World

Despite what NVIDIA CEO says, coding is **FUN**.  
When you're at work, at least for me, I'm building a tool for somebody to solve a problem, or we were both working on a singular problem where I took side A, and they took side B, but you never actually worked on the same thing together.  
It never gave you the sense of camaraderie that I would get when I was in school, where I liked to fight my way through it.

In school, you have problems that get presented to 20 people, 50 people; all have to solve the same problem themselves, and it allows me to kind of like talk through and think through a problem that may be hard for me with a bunch of people all at the same time.  
There's really not another time in life when this happens.  
That's why I want to learn Go :D

And there's no better way to learn than getting your hands dirty with little projects.

# Five Go Projects

This repository contains readmes for five different Go projects you can use to learn Go, as
described in the [YouTube video by Dreams of Code](https://youtu.be/gXmznGEW9vo)

Inside of this repository are 5 directories, each representing a single project idea.

Each of the project ideas contain a README and any supplementary resources or advice to help you build 
the project.

## 01 - Todo List CLI - DONE

This project is to build a CLI todo list called `tasks`. There is my own built version you can try out
on the releases page

## 02 - Backend API - WIP

This project is to build a backend API for a Calculator Service. There is a simple OpenAPI Specification on this
project to help you define the endpoints your API should support.

## 03 - Web Scraper - BLOCKED

This project is to build a simple web scraper to detect dead links on a webpage.

## 04 - URL Shortener - BLOCKED 

This project is to build a URL Shortener website entirely using Go, including both a Web frontend and a backend.

## 05 - Currency Converter - BLOCKED 

This last project is to build a currency converter for the terminal which uses the huh framework for creating a form and a third part API for obtaining the currency conversion data.


# General Getting Started Advice

For all projects, make sure you start off with a `main.go` and using `go mod init`
